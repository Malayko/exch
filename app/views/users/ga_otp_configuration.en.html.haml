%h1 Required steps for TOTP authentication
%h2 Why use one-time-password authentication ?
%p
  TOTP authentication adds a security layer on top of the login/password authentication
  mechanism. For your account to be compromised, an attacker must not only know your
  password, but also know your shared-secret or compromise your mobile device.
%p
  If you activate the "Require TOTP" option in your account settings you won't be
  able to sign in without providing a TOTP token. You can use the same token multiple
  times, but the token is time based and is only valid for 30 seconds. You need a
  Blackberry, Android or iPhone for the token generation.

%h2 Reset your shared-secret
%p
  If you think your mobile device has been compromised or if you think someone
  got a hold of your shared-secret you <strong>must</strong> reset it.
%p
  You will need to update your mobile device configuration.

    = submit_tag "Reset shared-secret", :class => "submit"
